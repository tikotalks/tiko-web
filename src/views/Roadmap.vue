        <p>Tikoâ€™s journey is just beginning. Our roadmap focuses on making communication easy and accessible for every child. In the short term, we're launching our first apps for Android, iOS, and Web, aiming to reach over 1,000 children. Next, we'll focus on customization features, multi-language support, and smart communication assistance powered by AI. As we grow, community feedback will shape Tikoâ€™s future â€” ensuring we build tools that truly make a difference.</p>
